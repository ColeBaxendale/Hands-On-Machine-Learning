# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & TensorFlow

Welcome to the GitHub repository for machine learning projects and exercises based on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & TensorFlow, 3rd Edition" by Aurélien Géron. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that cover the key concepts and practical examples needed to become proficient in machine learning.

## About the Book

"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, & TensorFlow" is a comprehensive guide that provides the theory, techniques, and practical know-how to design and implement machine learning solutions. This repository is structured to reflect the latest best practices and technologies in the field of machine learning, as presented in the third edition of the book.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, each corresponding to a chapter in the book. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks along with necessary datasets and images to provide a hands-on learning experience.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `keras`, `tensorflow`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:
